## Rust CLI program to process science class test scores

This is a simple CLI tool that can be run by an instructor to verify student answers on Unit Conversion worksheets.

After students turn in their completed worksheets, the teachers want to be able to
enter the questions and student responses into a computer to be graded. Students will convert:
* `Temperatures` between *Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine*
* `Volumes` between *liters, tablespoons, cubic-inches, cups, cubic-feet, and gallons*

## Requirements
1. The teacher must be able to provide an input numerical value, an input unit of measure, a target
unit of measure, and a student’s numeric response.
2. The system indicates that the response is **correct**, **incorrect**, or **invalid**. To be
considered **correct**, the student’s response must match an authoritative answer after both the
student’s response and authoritative answer are rounded to the *tenths* place.
